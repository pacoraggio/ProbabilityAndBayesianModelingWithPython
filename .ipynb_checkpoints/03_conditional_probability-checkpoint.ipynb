    "Suppose two baseball teams play in a \"best of five\" playoff series, where the first team to win three games wins the series. Suppose the Yankees play the Angels and one believes that the probability the Yankees will win a single game is 0.6. If the results of the games are assumed independent, what is the probability the Yankees win the series?\n",

    "This is a more sophisticated problem than the first example, since there are numerous outcomes of this series of games. The first thing to note is that the playoff can last three games, four games, or five games. In listing outcomes, one lets $Y$ and $A$ respectively the single-game outcomes \"Yankees win\" and \"Angels win\". Then a series result is represented by a sequence of letters. For example, $YYAY$ means that the Yankees won the first two games, the Angels won the third game, and the Yankees won the fourth game and the series. Using this notation, all of the possible outcomes of the five-game series are written below."
